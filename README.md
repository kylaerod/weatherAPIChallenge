# My Weather Application

## Description

This project is to allow the user to view the weather, time and overall environment where they currently reside. They should be able to refresh the page view the conditions outside updated accordingly. There is also a search bar that is used to search up other cities' conditions.

## Installation

This project was completed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Usage

By starting with a basic skeleton, you then add the Open Weather Map API for the function of the weather app.
